Scoring Algorithm:

What we get: {
    question1: "E.t.",
    question2: "Dragon"
    etc.
}

Make an answer Key:
{
    question1: "Yoda",
    question2: "Dragon"
    etc.
}


let score = 0
let maxScore = questionData.length
for loop i = 1, i< questionData.length, i++
if (!anserTracker.[`question${i}`]){continue}
if(answerTracker[`question${i}`] === answrKey[`question${i}`]){
    score++
}

let displayedScore = Math.floor((score/maxScore)*100)

if(displayedScore <= 30){
    render You are JAr Jar Binks
}
