-Stopping page going back when answer is pressed DONE-ISH?
-Sort out Pagination DONE



Scoring Algorithm:

What we get: {
    question1: "E.t.",
    question2: "Dragon"
    etc.
}

Make an answer Key:
{
    question1: "Yoda",
    question2: "Dragon"
    etc.
}


let score = 0
let maxScore = questionData.length
for loop i = 1, i< questionData.length, i++
if (!anserTracker.[`question${i}`]){continue}
if(answerTracker[`question${i}`] === answrKey[`question${i}`]){
    score++
}

let displayedScore = Math.floor((score/maxScore)*100)

if(displayedScore <= 30){
    render You are JAr Jar Binks
}

Styling radio buttons:


importing questions data, then handing into <RadioGroup radioButtons={questionsData.answers}/>
Currently handing in an array of labels, values and the id, 

store questionsData.answers into a state variable

Maybe useffect?
loop through that array, each object spread operator and create new object adding in style
